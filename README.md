# PlantNurseryChallenge
Project to water some plants remotely

### The Challenge:
Our office has 5 plants, and no one to water them. We don’t want them to die.
Create a .NET solution with a Web front-end that enables a user to water our plants remotely.

### User Stories:
1- As a user, I want to see a list of plants on a web page, as well as their watering status
2- As a user, I want to start and stop watering of a plant. A plant takes 10 seconds to
water.
3-The system should support watering multiple plants at the same time.
4- Plants need to rest from watering, so as a User, I should not be able to water the plant
again within 30 seconds of the last watering session.
5- As a user, I should be visually alerted if a plant hasn’t been watered for more than 6
hours.

### Other Requirements:
1. The backend must be written in C#.
2. The frontend can be written in any ui/javascript framework.
3. Provide clear instructions on how to launch the website.
4. State management can be implemented in any way.

# How It works:

- This Application has 5 plants.
- Each plant has a Button to start/stop watering.
- Besides the button, we have the status/state of the plant.
- There are 4 state: Watering, Normal, Flooded and Dried.
	- If someone is watering the plant, it is in Watering state.
	- If plant has been fully watered in last 6 hours, it is in Normal state.
	- If we don't stop watering even after 10 sec, it is in Flooded state.
	- If plant has not been fully watered in last 6 hours, it is in Dried state.
- After it is fully watered you can't start watering again within 30 seconds.
